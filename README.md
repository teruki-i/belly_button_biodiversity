This repository contains the following:
- A JSON file containing data on bacteria cultures collected from human belly buttons and data on the subjects that the cultures were collected from.
- A Javascript file with code that shows a specified subject's demographic data and creates charts regarding the bacteria cultures found in the selected and how frequently the subject washed their belly butoons.
